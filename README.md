# Use GitHub Copilot to write Python

Explore how you can modify a Python repository using code suggestions from GitHub Copilot to create an interactive HTML form and an Application Programming Interface (API) endpoint. By working with this repository, you'll quickly get hands-on with a Python web app that serves an HTTP API that generates a pseudo-random token, commonly used in for identification.

## Requirements

1. Enable your [GitHub Copilot service](https://github.com/github-copilot/signup)
1. Open [this repository with Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-copilot-codespaces-python)

## üí™üèΩ Exercise

The API already has a single endpoint to generate a token. Let's update the API by adding a new endpoint that accepts text and returns a list of tokens.

### üõ† Step 1: Add a Pydantic model

Go to the `main.py` file, and add a comment so that GitHub Copilot can generate a `Pydantic` model for you. The generated model should look like this:

```python
class Text(BaseModel): 

text: str
```

### üîé Step 2: Generate a new endpoint

Next, generate a new endpoint with GitHub Copilot by adding the comment: 

```python
# Create a FastAPI endpoint that accepts a POST request with a JSON body containing a single field called "text" and returns a checksum of the text 
```

### üêç Step 3: Add necessary imports

The generated code causes the application to crash. The crash happens because the `base64` and `os` modules aren't imported. Add the following lines to the top of the file:

```python
import base64 
import os
```

Finally, verify the new endpoint is working by trying it out by going to the `/docs` endpoint and confirming that the endpoint shows up.


üöÄ Congratulations, through the exercise, you haven't only used copilot to generate code but also done it in an interactive and fun way! You can use GitHub Copilot to not only generate code, but write documentation, test your applications and more.
